# Anomaly-detection

 Detecting anomalies has been a research topic for a long time. Due to the increasing amount of data collected in the modern world in broad domains such as risk management, compliance, security, financial surveillance, health and medical risk, and AI safety, the need for automated data analysis has become a necessity. One of the most critical tasks in data analysis is the detection of anomalous data points
# For the comparison we will use the PyOD Library for anomaly detection and we will generate random data

# Dataset :
The dataset is open source, From Kaggle (is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment).
The data set represents 219,521 readings from 51 sensors  that are used to do condition monitoring of pumps.
